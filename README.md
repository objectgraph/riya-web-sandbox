## How to use Git

Git is a powerful version control system used by programmers to keep track/record changes to files.

### Git with VSCode

- Within a new VSCode window, click clone from repository
- Copy and paste the repository URL into the prompted box
- You can commit by either using the GUI or the terminal
- To use the terminal, first open a new terminal pane
- Type the command `git status`
  - This will let you see the status of your github repo
- Then type the command `git add .`
  - This will add all the changes
  - This does not mean it is committed however
- Then type the command `git commit -m ""`
  - This will commit the changes and the `-m ""` means that inbetween the quotes you can add a message
    - It is improtant to add a meaningful message so you can look back at changes you made during the commit
    - This is extremely helpful for debugging and testing
- The final command is `git push`
  - This will push your code to the github repo and the changes will all be synced.
- To use the GUI the steps are pretty simliar
- Open the side panel called source control
- Under the changes pane click the + icon to add all the changes
- Once that is done, click the checkmark icon to commit the changes and add a message in the box
- Finally click sync which will push all the changes to the github repo
